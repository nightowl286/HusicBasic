# Husic (Music player)

## This is an ongoing project with its development currently paused.

This is also only a prototype I have made for it, it is nowhere near what I want from the final version, it is just a basic prototype meant for my experimentation.

It can play completely in the background, and also has a minimal gui window that can be opened as shown below.
